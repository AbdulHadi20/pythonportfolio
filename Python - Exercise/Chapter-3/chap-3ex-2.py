"""
Chapter 3, Exercise 2: Greetings

Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ['Shaheer', 'Shehroz', 'Zoraiz', 'Maahin', 'Ali']   # list of names

print('Hello ' + names[0] + ', Please let me know when you leave for home.') # calling every item specifically and printing a personalized msg
print('Hello ' + names[1] + ', Lets have tea after 9:00 pm.')
print('Hello ' + names[2] + ', How are you doing?')
print('Hello ' + names[3] + ', Have a safe flight to Thailand.')
print('Hello ' + names[4] +
      ', When are you free? I want you to join us for dinner.')
